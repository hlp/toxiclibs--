toxiclibs-- (toxiclibs minus minus)

About:
C++ port of the toxiclibs project (http://toxiclibs.org) developed by Karsten Schmidt
Requires Cinder (http://libcinder.org)

Notes:
I've tried to keep the style and naming conventions as close to those of 
the original java library. Otherwise, I follow the Google C++ style guide 
(http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml).
