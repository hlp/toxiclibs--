toxiclibs-- (toxiclibs minus minus)

About:
C++ port of the toxiclibs project (http://toxiclibs.org) developed by Karsten Schmidt

Requirements:
- Cinder (http://libcinder.org)
- C++ compiler with std::shared_ptr and multiple closing angle bracket support 
  (eg vector<vector<int>>)

Notes:
I've tried to keep the style and naming conventions as close to those of 
the original java library. Otherwise, I follow the Google C++ style guide 
(http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.xml).
